# API List for J-Hub Front End

This app currently makes **no external HTTP API calls** for jobs or bookmarks.

## Current runtime data source
1. Local static dataset import
   - Description: Job listings are loaded from a local file, not from a remote API.
   - Source: `src/data/jobs.js` is imported in `App.js` and used directly via `sortedJobs`/`bookmarkedJobs`.

## Network/API calls currently implemented
- None.

## Notes
- Applying to a job currently triggers a local `Alert` only.
- Bookmarking/saved jobs are maintained in local React state (`bookmarkedJobIds`) only.
- If backend APIs are added later, this file should be updated with endpoint, method, payload, response shape, and purpose.
